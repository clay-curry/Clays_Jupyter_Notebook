    "#### What this is\n",
    "It's on my mind almost every time I go fishing, did I pick the right spot and am I using the right bait? The predictive fishing system is recommendation engine will use cutting edge data science techniques to suggest where to fish and bait. Additionally, users can interact with a dashboard where they can view analytics for all known fishing spots or run custom filters to test theories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond suggesting where to fish and lure/bait suggestions, this system will use cutting edge data science methods to predict the following information:\n",
    "* **expected catch rate by species given lure/bait selection and spot** \n",
    "* **expected catch rate by species given electronic fish-finder activity**\n",
    "\n",
    "These expectations will be given along with confidence intervals.\n",
