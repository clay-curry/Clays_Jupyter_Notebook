# Clays_Jupyter_Notebook

# Description
This under-development repository is my personal knowledge map of everything mathematics, theoretical computer science, chemistry, and biology from current and previous studies. My end goal is to create a visualizable directed graph of my personal references and research notes as one section of my future website. These references will be used for research and literature reviews. 

# How-To-Navigate
The "porting" branch is where I am committing my existing handwritten and LaTeX notes on various topics. My hope is that this workflow will not be open for too much longer. The "developing" branch indicates the topics I am currently working on, for research, work, and personal interest. From this branch, you will find my most recent work.
