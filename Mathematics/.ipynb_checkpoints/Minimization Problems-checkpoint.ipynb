    "The following problem often arises: given a subspace $U \\subsetneq V$ of a vector space $V$ and a point $u$ that is outside of $U$, find the closest point $cv \\in U$ to the point $u \\not \\in U$. In other words, find the number $c$ that scales $v \\in U$ where the value of $||u-cv||$ is as small as possible. In the mathematical literature, the name this point the **orthogonal projection of u onto U**. The following illustration distills the essence of this problem:\n",

After solving the orthogonal projection problem, this paper demonstrates how the orthogonal projection problem is equivalent to a similar problem called the **minimal surface problem** whose goal is to find a *surface* in some vector space $V$ (an inner product space, to be precise) that is as close as possible to a finite or infinite set of elements $\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots\\} \\subseteq V$."

    "For a plane, the problem statement is the following: given a collection of points $\\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$, what process might be used to find the values of $a, b,$ and $c$ that generates a plane as close as possible to the data points $\\{d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n\\}$. Though we will demonstrante the process of calculating these parameters can be extended to higher dimensions and even to polynomial functions regressing on the data.\n",

    "Given three fixed points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, it is easy to imagine (and calculate) the plane intersecting all three points. With some algebra, it can be shown rigorously that *any plane is uniquely characterized by three points.* That is, **for any three fixed points, there will always exist one plane intersecting the three points.** A similar characterization exists for any function for a plane.  Assuming there exists a functional relationship between the two arguments of a function and and its planar output, any plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is uniquely characterized by three numbers called the **parameters**. The function for any plane in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ takes the form:\n",

    "f(x,y) = ax + by + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are the aforementioned **parameters** of $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A harder problem is to find the plane that is as close as possible a set of points which are not coplanar (there does not exist a plane intersecting all of them). An even harder problem is to find any surface that is as close as possible to a set of points. Thankfully, by finding a general method for determining the parameters, we will see that the latter problem is not that much harder than the former. Finding the minimimal surface involves a concept known as **orthogonal projection** and an algebraic technique called the **Gram-Schmidt Process**.\n",
